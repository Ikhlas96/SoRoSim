**The SoRoSim Toolbox**

SoRoSim, or Soft Robot Simulator, is a MATLAB toolbox that uses the Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) approach to provide a unified framework for the modeling, analysis, and control of soft, rigid, and hybrid robots. The toolbox can be used to analyze open-, closed- and branched structures and allows the user to model many different external loading and actuation scenarios. The soft links are modeled as a Cosserat rod, a 1D, slender rod accounting for bend, twist, stretch, and shear. MATLAB GUI assists in creating links, their assembly, the assignment of DoFs, and the definition of external and actuation forces. 

The examples folder of the toolbox contains some saved linkages and links for which you can run simulations.

Find the overview of the toolbox, validation, and examples of problems that can be analyzed using SoRoSim in our IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine paper, "SoRoSim: A MATLAB Toolbox for Hybrid Rigid-Soft Robots Based on the Geometric Variable-Strain Approach"
