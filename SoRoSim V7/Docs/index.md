Sorosim is an open-source soft robotics simulator that implements that geometric variable strain (GVS) approach proposed for soft robots in ==\\cite{}==. The toolbox is designed for ease of use and provides a GUI to create cosserat rods that may be assembled in open, closed, or branched chains. Moreover, various external forces like gravity, ==Contact==, bouyancy etc. 

The matlab implementation of the toolbox can be downloaded from [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/83038-sorosim](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/83038-sorosim)
