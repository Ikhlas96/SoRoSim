# Strain parametrisation
The continous strain fields are parameterised by a finite functional basis of strain modes. This allows us to discretize the model and have tractable computation. The strain will then be given in general by:
\\[\xi(X,\mathbf{q},t) = \mathbf{\Psi}_\xi(X, \mathbf{q}, t) + \xi^* \\]
Where \\( \mathbf{\Psi_{\xi}} \in \mathbb{R}^{6\times 1}\\) is the general form of the strain field, and \\(\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{ndof}\\) is the generalised coordinates.
