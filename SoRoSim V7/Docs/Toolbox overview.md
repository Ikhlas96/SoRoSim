The Sorosim toolbox is an implementation of the Geometric variable strain approach for modelling soft robots ==[1]==. An object orientated approach is adopted in this implementation of the toolbox. There are three main objects used for this toolbox:
 - [[SorosimLink]]
 - [[SorosimLinkage]]
 - [[SorosimTwists]]
 Each of these objects have some properties associated with them that define the robot and some functions that describe the behaviour of the robot. Using the three classes together we are able to simulate a wide variety of soft robots and their behaviour.
